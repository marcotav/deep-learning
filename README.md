## painter-identifier

The goal of this project is to use Transfer Learning to build a Convolutional Neural Network (or ConvNet) to identify the artist of a painting. More details [here](https://github.com/marcotav/deep-learning/blob/master/painters-identification/README.md),

## bitcoin

My goal was to build predictive models for the price of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. I used Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural networks (LSTMs). More details [here](https://github.com/marcotav/deep-learning/blob/master/bitcoin/README.md),

## keras-tf-tutorial

In this notebook I will build and train two types of neural network using the MNIST dataset, namely:
- A fully-connected neural network using TensorFlow
- A Keras convolutional network

More details [here](https://github.com/marcotav/deep-learning/blob/master/keras-tf-tutorial/README.md),

## transfer-learning-mini-tutorial

Keras has many well-known pre-trained image recognition models already built in. These models are trained using images from the Imagenet data set, a collection of millions of pictures of labeled objects. Transfer learning is when we reuse these pre-trained models in consort with our own models. If you need to recognize an object not included in the Imagenet set, you can start with the pre-trained model and fine-tune it if need be, and that makes things much easier and faster than starting from scratch. I illustrate this using the Inception V3 deep neural network model.
